# SmsTraffic for Laravel

## Details

Inspired by [Laravel Vonage Notification Channel](https://github.com/laravel/vonage-notification-channel).

## Note
This library implements limited functionality.

## Documentation

Sending SMS notifications in Laravel is powered by [SMS Traffic](https://www.smstraffic.ru/). Before you can send notifications via SMS Traffic, you need to install the `dmitrakovich/smstraffic-for-laravel` and `guzzlehttp/guzzle` packages:
```shell
composer require dmitrakovich/smstraffic-for-laravel guzzlehttp/guzzle
```
The package includes a [configuration file](https://github.com/dmitrakovich/smstraffic-for-laravel/blob/main/config/smstraffic.php). However, you are not required to export this configuration file to your own application. You can simply use environment variables.
```properties
SMSTRAFFIC_SMS_FROM=
SMSTRAFFIC_LOGIN=
SMSTRAFFIC_PASSWORD=
SMSTRAFFIC_ROUTE=
```
### Formatting SMS Notifications

If a notification supports being sent as an SMS, you should define a `toSmsTraffic` method on the notification class. This method will receive a `$notifiable` entity and should return an `Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SmsTrafficMessage` instance:
```php
/**
 * Get the SmsTraffic / SMS representation of the notification.
 *
 * @param  mixed  $notifiable
 * @return \Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SmsTrafficMessage
 */
public function toSmsTraffic($notifiable)
{
    return (new SmsTrafficMessage)
                ->content('Your SMS message content');
}
```
#### Notification route

If you would like to send some notifications to another route that is different route specified by your `SMSTRAFFIC_ROUTE` environment variable, you may call the `route` method on a `SmsTrafficMessage` instance:
```php
/**
 * Get the SmsTraffic / SMS representation of the notification.
 *
 * @param  mixed  $notifiable
 * @return \Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SmsTrafficMessage
 */
public function toSmsTraffic($notifiable)
{
    return (new SmsTrafficMessage)
                ->content('Your unicode message')
                ->route('whatsapp(180)-sms');
}
```
### Customizing The "From" Number

If you would like to send some notifications from a phone number that is different from the phone number specified by your `SMSTRAFFIC_SMS_FROM` environment variable, you may call the `from` method on a `SmsTrafficMessage` instance:
```php
/**
 * Get the SmsTraffic / SMS representation of the notification.
 *
 * @param  mixed  $notifiable
 * @return \Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SmsTrafficMessage
 */
public function toSmsTraffic($notifiable)
{
    return (new SmsTrafficMessage)
                ->content('Your SMS message content')
                ->from('15554443333');
}
```
### Routing SMS Notifications

To route SmsTraffic notifications to the proper phone number, define a `routeNotificationForSmsTraffic` method on your notifiable entity:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable;

    /**
     * Route notifications for the SmsTraffic channel.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Notifications\Notification  $notification
     * @return string
     */
    public function routeNotificationForSmsTraffic($notification)
    {
        return $this->phone_number;
    }
}
```
### Using The SmsTraffic Facade

Alternatively, you may send notifications via the \Illuminate\Notifications\Facades\SmsTraffic facade:
```php
SmsTraffic::send($phones, $message);
```
